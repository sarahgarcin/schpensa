  title: Description of the project
  text: |
    *Schpensa* (i.e a pantry found in old Grisons houses where potatoes, flour, apples, etc. are stored) is a collective project exploring the history and potential future of the potato, as part of a long lineage of collaborations between humans and “kulturpflanzen”, where Arosa, whose land was traded for potatoes, has been placed as the starting point of an investigation of this plant’s past, present and future potential.
    
    Our landscapes are in a very particular moment of rapid transformation with measurable changes in crop production, yield, and growth. Urbanization and globalization patterns have also accelerated demand causing large shifts in the supply chain infrastructure. Understanding our food, and where it comes from allows us on the one hand to grasp our own historic past by questioning precepts of what culture and identity can mean in a globalized world. On the other hand, it also sheds light on the role of agriculture in emitting greenhouse gases itself, and thus, contributing to climatic transformation, directly affecting crop production, yield, and growth. Altogether, the food system is estimated to contribute 20-30% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. About 24% of that percentage is being emitted in farming/agriculture and land-use change practices, and approximately 5-10% stems from later stages in the food system: processing, packaging, transport, retail, preparation, and waste disposal.
    
    Thanks to the connection created by the Arvae team with local experts, we were introduced during our field research trips to the story of Arosa land being traded to Chur for potatoes. Schpensa aims to bridge historical, scientific, traditional, and culinary knowledge, while daring to formulate a prediction about the potato's role and agricultural potential in the future. Schpensa provides insights about the origins and the following long journey from its origins to Arosa of the potato, it maps its production, transport routes, land-use history and policies, and describes its forms, taste, colours, as well as its continuous influence on the town of Arosa. Schpensa further explores how the food system provides us with the common ground necessary to consider identity and place, while addressing the importance of food security and biodiversity as one of the main ecological challenges of our time.

    As for all web platforms, Schpensa’s growing archive implies energy consumption and circulation of data. We therefore asked ourselves how this website could live up to our ambitions for a carbon neutral project? And how we could link the topic of sustainable cultivation of local crops with the way we cultivate our presence online? These are questions that have been leading our work with the online archive Schpensa.
    
    Berenice Serra and Sarah Garcin walked us through some simple measures we can take to minimize the climate impact of our online archive.
