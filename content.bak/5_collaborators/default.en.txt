        Tina is the third generation to run the charming, family-owned chalet hotel Sonnenhalde and hosted the members of the «Kollektiv» during their stay in Arosa. A passionate hotelier, she was born and raised in Arosa and – as she has discovered during several stays abroad – cannot imagine a more beautiful place to live. She shares her fascination for the beauty of Arosa and her attachment to the local culture to her guests with dedication and charm. Tina joined the arvae team as local coordinator of our first «Kollektiv» in Arosa, mediating between the local citizens and stakeholders, «Kollektiv» members and our team.

        Anne-Laure studied Fine Arts in Zurich and Art History in Paris. She currently works as research assistant at Luzern University within the department of Cultural Studies, with a focus on artistic research. Her work is concerned with questions of labour, representations and hierarchies of dignity (related to  beings, objects and practices), as well as strategies of self-organization and maintenance within artistic practices. She is interested in the intersections between botany and industry, between wilderness and civilized world, between authorized or sanctioned migration and spontaneous settlement. She uses techniques of displacing and retracing to question mapping and archiving practices. Amongst other collaborative ventures, she is part of the interdisciplinary study group (link: http://www.tetigroup.org text: TETI) (textures and experiences of trans-industriality). In 2013 she initiated both the (link: http://www.zurichartspaceguide.ch text: Zurich Art Space Guide), a free listing of artist run spaces, and (link: https://www.volumeszurich.ch text: VOLUMES), an organisation researching and showcasing art publishing practices.

        Tara is a producer and curator
        particularly interested in working on
        experimental, interdisciplinary,
        collective, and non-institutional
        collaborations for diverse publics. Her
        practice-based experiences permeate
        institutions, manifesting in public
        spaces, off-spaces and open fields. She
        has produced artistic projects
        intersecting with climate science,
        communications, social and political
        activism, and pedagogy. Tara has
        initiated numerous platforms for
        emerging artists to present their works
        to new audiences, mentored artists,
        organised public space interventions,
        curated festivals, summer schools, and
        performance programs, and hosted artist
        residencies. She works closely with
        artists and collectives on land-based,
        decolonial, and performative practices.
        Her research on the role art plays in an
        environmentally fragile context like
        Bangladesh was published as input for
        the OHCHR report on climate change,
        culture, and cultural rights. Her focus
        on production while developing support
        systems and sustainable conditions for
        artists drives her current works.

        Before joining forces with Tara to start
        arvae, Alex built platforms and bridges
        for artists and designers who work with
        new technology and science. With an
        academic background in international
        relations, cultural management and
        cultural policy in urban development,
        she has always been interested in where
        the arts meet other sectors, disciplines
        and logics. She has dedicated her career
        to holding space for free artistic
        practices within these other structures
        and fostering understanding for the
        value of other disciplines collaborating
        with the arts. She believes that we can
        most effectively make this world a
        better place by working together and
        that every fruitful collaboration starts
        and succeeds in honest human connection.
        This is what she strives to contribute
        to with arvae.

        Raised in the eastern part of
        Switzerland, Bettina has been living in
        Arosa and working in gastronomy for the
        past four years. As a Deputy Manager at
        the Restaurant Güterschuppen she can
        follow her passion for food and enjoy
        the beautiful nature around the
        Schanfigg valley. A summer job in a
        mountain hut on 2300 m a.s.l. gave way
        to her wish to work in gastronomy after
        working at an international Grisons
        energy company, receiving her
        bachelor’s degree in business
        administration, and gaining work
        experience in the areas of human
        resources development, marketing,
        sponsoring, and events. In her spare
        time she loves cooking with local and
        seasonal ingredients from the market or
        her parents’ garden.

        Seit dem Sommer 2020 gibt es in Arosa ein Natur Labor. Sie erfahren in diesem Entdeckungszentrum mitten im Dorf Details zu «Arosa 2030», der Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie von Arosa und über das Arosa Bärenland und die geplante Bären Akademie.
        Zudem gibt ein Teammitglied der Arosa Tourismus Gästeinformation vor Ort Auskunft über Arosa und dem vielfältigen Angebot in der Region. Das Natur Labor ist ein erster Versuch die Thematik Regionalität, lokale Verbundenheit in Kombination mit nationalen Partner innovativ und zukunftsträchtig zu etablieren. Aller Anfang macht Spass und animiert zu wirkungsvollen Projekten.
