How a tool cut the moisture?

As I exposed to sunlight, I was also detached from the body of a plant. Light was there, photosynthesis was not.

I transformed, as taste, smell, colour and structure. I transformed through tools, time, profit, greed, machines, population and loaded hunger.

Under the soil, itâ€™s a different world. An iron tool, layered with warmth of hunger pierced within my body and I become separated from myself. I got exposed to sky, winds, and uncountable empty stomachs.

The fireplace in winter becomes the place of collective sharing and roasting potatoes for lunch and dinner. 

The wrinkles and skin colour of these hands of multiple gender and age are the evidence of weather, intensity of light, land holdings, their architectural settings, nature of work they do and the materials they work with with.

These hands are the hands of farmers from my family in Nadaon village. These hands planted potatoes and other crops in countless seasons.

## Cultivators Note  
On the bed of toil and worries,
All night,  
A sleepless season rolls from one side to another.
On the crossroad of conflicts, care harassed and wounded.  
With age, a wrinkle begun to sprout in my eyes, my vision cracked and disappear.
The crust of my dream is deteriorating, and the core is shivering.
I am a landless cultivator.
I plough dead soils,
And looking for the moisture, here and there like a thirsty bird.
My body roasted by the heavy rains in monsoon.
Beneath my feet are the primitive cracks, with cracked skin I walk from one civilization to another.
After that,
I stopped harvesting knowledge
And I am tired of discoveries and explorations.
