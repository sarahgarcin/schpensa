    Twenty 500 Litre pots overseen by local plant hosts are placed throughout the municipality of Arosa will host the planting of potatoes. The decorative flowers will be joined by pots of potatoes and other cultivated crops. They will show the potential of the local production of alpine crops as well as illustrate the care that goes into food cycles. We are collaborating with the Gemeinde in Arosa and their town gardeners as well as the experimental station of Agroscope in Maran to grow potatoes in the mobile garden pots.
    
    152 tubers of 15/18 (??) different plants have been planted in mid may.  What will be the harvest out of it?
    
    Most of the species are supported by Pro Specie Rare, a Swiss Foundation that supports the biodiversity of cultivated plants within the country.
    
    The pots contain ⅔ of humus and ⅓ of Misapor, a material that allows the perfect drainage. Furthermore, holes are drilled into the pots in order to allow the water to spill out.
